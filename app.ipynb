They are designed to serve specific purposes such as data collection, processing, monitoring, control, or providing a user interface, and are often incorporated into various devices, including wearable devices and accessories.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 123, 'prompt_tokens': 698, 'total_tokens': 821, 'completion_time': 0.328588044, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.034292323, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.161872647, 'total_time': 0.362880367}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3272ea2d91', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019bdcde-bc3c-7900-b8c0-07eb7b92d026-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 698, 'output_tokens': 123, 'total_tokens': 821}),\n",
